# Evaluating and Improving Framework-Based Parallel Code Completion with Large Language Models

This repository contains the dataset, models, and evaluation scripts for our paper.


## üß© Overview

With the growing complexity of modern computing workloads, **parallel programming** has become essential for exploiting the performance potential of multicore CPUs, GPUs, and distributed clusters.  
However, **a vast amount of legacy code in scientific and engineering domains remains serial**, failing to utilize available parallel hardware.

To address this gap, developers increasingly face the need to **transform sequential functions into parallel code**, often using multiple frameworks simultaneously ‚Äî such as combining **OpenMP**, **MPI**, and **CUDA** within a single application.

To better understand this real-world demand, we analyzed open-source HPC repositories on GitHub:


**Key finding:**

- **59.6%** of repositories combine two or more parallel frameworks (e.g., OpenMP + MPI + CUDA).
- Only **40.4%** of repositories use a single framework.

This shows that real-world HPC development frequently involves **multi-framework integration**, tailored to meet diverse performance goals and heterogeneous hardware constraints.



### üîç We Introduce: Framework-Based Parallel Code Completion (FPCC)

Despite the increasing demand for automatic parallelization, **existing datasets and methods** overwhelmingly focus on narrow, single-framework settings.  
This significantly limits their **practical relevance** in assisting real-world development workflows.

To bridge this gap, we propose **Framework-Based Parallel Code Completion (FPCC)** ‚Äî a realistic code generation task that requires large language models to:

1. üß† **Identify insertion points** for parallel directives in serial code,  
2. ‚öôÔ∏è **Select the appropriate parallel framework** (e.g., OpenMP, MPI, CUDA),  
3. üßæ **Generate complete and correct directive statements**, including proper clause usage.


FPCC moves beyond basic API generation tasks and frames parallelization as a **structured transformation problem** ‚Äî requiring **multi-step reasoning over program structure, control flow, and data dependencies**.

By aligning evaluation with real-world code transformation needs, FPCC offers a principled benchmark for building next-generation intelligent assistants for parallel programming.
