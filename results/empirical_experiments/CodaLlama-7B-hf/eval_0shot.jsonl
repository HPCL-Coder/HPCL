In this project, we will implement the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.\n\n\n### Project Goals\n\nThe project goal is to design a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of abnormal heart rhythms (AHR) using the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal.\n\n\n### Project Background\n\nIn the past 50 years, many studies have been conducted to improve the diagnosis of AHRs, and the number of AHRs has increased. For this reason, the number of people suffering from heart disease is increasing, which has an impact on society and health care. In order to improve the detection of AHRs, a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm is required.\n\n\n### Project Objectives\n\n1.\tDevelop a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of AHRs.\n2.\tCompare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms.\n3.\tImplement the proposed algorithm in Matlab and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.\n\n\n### Project Tasks\n\nThe tasks of this project are as follows:\n\n1.\tDesign a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of AHRs.\n2.\tCompare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms.\n3.\tImplement the proposed algorithm in Matlab and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.\n\n\n### Project Methodology\n\nThe proposed methodology is as follows:\n\n1.\tCollecting and preprocessing the data.\n2.\tDesigning the proposed algorithm.\n3.\tImplementing the proposed algorithm in Matlab.\n4.\tE", "label": "(27, OpenMP, auto start_clock = omp_get_wtime();); (44, OpenMP, auto stop_clock = omp_get_wtime();)"}

Acyclic Graph\n\n   A graph is called acyclic if it does not contain any cycle.\n\n### Representation of Graphs\n\nA graph can be represented in many ways:\n\n1. Adjacency Matrix\n\n   An adjacency matrix is a square matrix with a row and a column for each node. The element of the matrix is 1 if there is an edge between two nodes and 0 if there is no edge between two nodes.\n\n2. Adjacency List\n\n   An adjacency list is a list of lists. The first list is associated with the first node, the second list is associated with the second node, and so on. Each element of the inner list is an edge connecting the node to another node.\n\n3. Incidence Matrix\n\n   An incidence matrix is a square matrix with a row and a column for each edge. The element of the matrix is 1 if the node is connected to the edge and 0 if the node is not connected to the edge.\n\n### Properties of Graphs\n\n1. Number of Vertices: V\n\n   Number of vertices in a graph is the number of nodes.\n\n2. Number of Edges: E\n\n   Number of edges in a graph is the number of edges.\n\n3. Degree of a Vertex: d(", "label": "(13, OpenMP, #pragma omp parallel for)"}

In this project, we will implement the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.\n\n\n### Project Goals\n\nThe project goal is to design a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of abnormal heart rhythms (AHR) using the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal.\n\n\n### Project Background\n\nIn the past few years, the number of people with cardiac diseases has increased, and this has led to a rise in the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The main reason for the increase in the number of people with cardiac diseases is that the incidence of SCA has increased over the past few years. SCA is the leading cause of death in young people, and it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nIn the past, AHR detection was performed using the QRS complex detection method, but the accuracy of this method has decreased. In addition, the use of QRS complex detection is limited to real-time applications. To overcome these limitations, the goal of this project is to design a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of abnormal heart rhythms (AHR) using the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal.\n\n### Project Objectives\n\n- To design a high-performance, real-time, data-driven algorithm for the detection of abnormal heart rhythms (AHR) using the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal.\n\n- To implement the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.\n\n### Project Outline\n\n- Data Acquisition\n- Pre-Processing\n- Feature Extraction\n- Feature Selection\n- Model Building\n- Performance Evaluation\n- Results\n\n### Project Dataset\n\nThe project", "label": "(15, CUDA, __shared__ float rr[TILE_T][N], kk[TILE_T][N];)"}

It also supports the [Dialogflow API](https://dialogflow.com/)\nto perform natural language queries.\n\nIt is intended to be a tool which can be used by anyone, without requiring any\nkind of registration. It is intended to be a simple and easy to use tool.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nAssistant requires Python 3.4+ to be installed on your system. It is also\nrecommended to install the `pyaudio` package, which allows Assistant to\nrecord audio from the microphone.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install Assistant by using the `pip` package manager.\n\n```bash\npip install assistant\n```\n\nThis will install Assistant and all its dependencies. You can then use\n`assistant` from the command line.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou can invoke Assistant by running the `assistant` command. You will be prompted\nto enter your voice query. If you want to record your voice query, you can\npress <kbd>Enter</kbd> and it will prompt you to say your query.\n\nYou can also run Assistant from a script.

{"predict": "A Personal Assistant for the Masses\n==============================================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/julienr/assistant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/julienr/assistant)\n\nThis is a project to create a personal assistant for the masses.\n\nCurrently, it's a simple REST API which uses a number of external APIs.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe project is split into two main parts:\n\n- the REST API\n- the backend, which calls external APIs\n\n#### The REST API\n\nThe REST API is written in Go. It uses the [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router and the [negroni](https://github.com/urfave/negroni) middleware.\n\nThe API uses the [GORM](http://gorm.io/) ORM.\n\nThe API uses the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework to serve the API and the [Swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger) package to serve the Swagger documentation.\n\n#### The backend\n\nThe backend is written in Python. It uses the [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests) package to call external APIs.\n\nThe backend also uses the [grequests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests) package to parallelize API calls.\n\nThe backend is structured as a set of modules. Each module is a Python package.\n\nThe modules are:\n\n- `google`: for Google's services\n- `wolfram`: for Wolfram Alpha's services\n- `openweathermap`: for OpenWeatherMap's services\n\nEach module has a `settings.py` file, where the API keys are stored.\n\nEach module has a `call` function. This function takes a string, which is the query, and returns a JSON object.\n\nThe API routes are defined in `routes.py`.\n\nThe `main.py` file runs the API and the backend in parallel.\n\n### Deployment\n\nTo deploy the application, the following must be done:\n\n- create a virtualenv", "label": "(16, MPI, MPI_Comm_set_errhandler(MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_ERRORS_RETURN);)"}

{"predict": "I'm a computer science student at the University of California, Berkeley,\nand I'm doing my thesis on the [Kanren](http://kanren.org/) constraint\nprogramming language.\n\n\nKanren\n======\n\nKanren is a constraint-based logic programming language. It's a small\nlibrary of simple rules for manipulating constraints and sequences of\nvalues. For example, it has a rule for unifying two numbers, which\nunifies them if they are equal. Or a rule for unifying a variable with\na number, which unifies it with the number if it's a number, and fails\notherwise.\n\nYou can use Kanren in a number of ways. One way is to use it as a\nlibrary for a larger logic programming language. In that case, you\ndefine your own rules and use Kanren to implement them. For example,\nyou can write a rule for unifying a variable with a list of numbers,\nand Kanren will generate a sequence of substitutions that make the\nvariable unify with each of the numbers in the list.\n\nYou can also use Kanren as a mini-logic programming language in its\nown right. In that case, you write your own rules and use Kanren to\ngenerate a sequence of substitutions that make them all hold.\n\nThe most common way to use Kanren is to use it as a mini-logic\nprogramming language in its own right. This is how it's used in\nthe [Knowledge Networks](http://kanren.org/knowledge-networks.html)\nexample.\n\n\nKnowledge Networks\n==================\n\nThe Knowledge Networks example shows how to use Kanren as a mini-logic\nprogramming language in its own right. It defines a set of rules for\nrepresenting facts about a fictional world, and then it uses Kanren to\ngenerate a sequence of substitutions that make all the facts hold.\n\nTo see the example, run `kanren.py` in the `examples` directory.\n\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\nThe example below is from the Knowledge Networks example.\n\n\n```python\nimport kanren\n\n\n# A fact is a rule that unifies the first argument with the second.\n\nfacts = [\n    kanren.eq(kan", "label": "(47, OpenMP, EXPECT_TRUE(check_test_image(output_file, t_apcomp_baseline_dir()));); (9, MPI, MPI_Comm_rank(comm, &par_rank);); (10, MPI, apcomp::mpi_comm(MPI_Comm_c2f(comm));); (8, MPI, MPI_Comm_size(comm, &par_size);)"}

{"predict": "I'm a computer science student at the University of California, Berkeley,\nand I'm doing my thesis on the [Kanren](http://kanren.org/) constraint\nprogramming language.\n\n\nKanren\n======\n\nKanren is a constraint-based logic programming language. It's a small\nlibrary of primitives for implementing a logic programming language,\nand Kanren itself is written in Common Lisp.\n\nIn Kanren, you define a \"goal\", which is a collection of constraints\nthat must be satisfied.  For example, we can define a goal that\nrepresents the goal of finding all the numbers in the range 1 to 5\nthat are divisible by 3:\n\n```lisp\n(defun divisible-by-3 (x)\n  (== (mod x 3) 0))\n\n(goal (== (list (find divisible-by-3 1 5))\n          '(3 6)))\n```\n\nThe `find` function takes a predicate and a range of values, and\nreturns the first value in that range that satisfies the predicate.\nThe `==` operator is a constraint that represents equality.  In this\ncase, the constraint says that the result of `find` should be equal\nto the number 3, and then the constraint says that the result of\n`find` should be equal to the number 6.\n\nYou can think of a constraint as a kind of equation.  It represents\nan equation that is true, and the values that satisfy that equation\nare the solutions to the equation.\n\nKanren is very flexible, and you can use it to solve many different\nkinds of problems.

The Assistant does this by reading the\n[manifest.json](manifest.json.md) file.\n\nThe Assistant will read the manifest.json file, and will use the\n“handlers” section to find out which code to call.\n\nThe manifest.json file is a simple JSON file that lists the names of\nall the functions in your app.\n\nHere is an example manifest.json file:\n\n```\n{\n    \"handlers\": [\n        \"getIndex\",\n        \"getItem\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe manifest.json file will tell the Assistant that the following\nfunctions are available for use:\n\n* getIndex\n* getItem\n\nThe Assistant will look for the code for these functions in your\napp.js file.\n\n### Assistant and the app.js file\n\nThe Assistant will look for the code for the functions listed in the\nmanifest.json file in your app.js file.\n\nIf the Assistant can’t find the code for a function in your app.js\nfile, it will respond with an error.\n\n### How to use the Assistant\n\nWhen you run your app, the Assistant will listen for incoming requests\nfrom Google Assistant.\n\nThe Assistant will then execute the code in your app.js file for the\nfunction listed in the request.\n\nThe Assistant will then respond to Google Assistant with the results of\nthe execution.\n\nFor example, if the Assistant receives a request to get a product, it\nwill call the function getItem() in your app.js file.\n\nThe getItem() function in your app.js file will then read the product\ninformation from a spreadsheet and return it to the Assistant.\n\nThe Assistant will then respond to Google Assistant with the results of\nthe execution.\n\nThe Assistant will also respond to Google Assistant with any errors that\noccur.\n\n### The", "label": "(15, OpenMP, #pragma omp target map(from:px)); (7, OpenMP, #pragma omp target data map(to:x[0:count])); (21, OpenMP, #pragma omp target data use_device_ptr(x)); (26, OpenMP, #pragma omp target data use_device_addr(x[0:0]))"}

{"predict": "The Assistant is the brain of your app. It’s responsible for\nhandling all incoming and outgoing requests and is responsible for\ncalling all your code.\n\nThe Assistant’s role is to listen for incoming requests and then\nexecute the code that corresponds to the request.\n\nTo do this, the Assistant will need to know which code to call for\neach request.\n\nFor this reason, the Assistant needs to know which functions to call\nand how to call them.\n\n### The App.js File\n\nThe first step is to create a new file called App.js.\n\nOpen App.js and copy the following code into it:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nvar app = express();\n\n// use body parser so we can get info from POST and/or URL parameters\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n// default route\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n  res.send('Hello World!');\n});\n\n// listen for requests\nvar listener = app.listen(process.env.PORT, function () {\n  console.log('Your app is listening on port ' + listener.address().port);\n});\n```\n\nNow let’s walk through the code.\n\nFirst, we require the Express and body-parser modules. Express is a\nframework for building Node.js web applications. body-parser allows\nExpress to parse the body of POST requests.\n\nNext, we set up Express to use body-parser.\n\nThen, we set up a default route. This route will respond to any GET\nrequests made to the root URL (i.e. http://localhost:3000/). In this\nexample, we send the message “Hello World!” to the client.\n\nFinally, we set up Express to listen for requests on the port that\nyou set up in your Heroku app.\n\n### Deploying the App\n\nThe Assistant needs to be deployed to Heroku.\n\nOpen a new terminal window and type the following:\n\n```bash\n$ git init\n$ heroku create\n$ git add .\n$ git commit -am \"first commit\"\n$ git push heroku", "label": "(44, MPI, MPI_T_finalize();); (19, MPI, MPI_T_init_thread(required, &provided);)"}
